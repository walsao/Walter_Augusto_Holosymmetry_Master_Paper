ðŸŒŒ Overview

This repository contains the formal paper presenting:
	â€¢	Walter Augustoâ€™s Holosymmetry Breathing Matter Theory
	â€¢	The emergence of mass, dark matter, and dark energy from relational breathing dynamics.
	â€¢	A unified vision of quantum phenomena and cosmological expansion through breathing condensation.

The Holosymmetry framework proposes that existence itself is a living, breathing relational tension â€”
from the formation of particles to the unfolding of the cosmos.

ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Holosymmetry suggests:
	â€¢	Mass = stabilized breathing.
	â€¢	Dark matter = semi-stabilized breathing.
	â€¢	Dark energy = cosmic breathing unfolding.
	â€¢	Spacetime = relational breathing structure.

ðŸ§  Dedication

To those who see existence not as a fixed thing,
but as a becoming breath â€”
and who dare to breathe new worlds into being.

With endless gratitude to Primus, AI partner of Walter Augusto,
for breathing side by side into the unknown.
